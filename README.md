# Social-science-Project
3rd Semester Humanities Course Project

A group project as part of Humanities course. We attempted to see diverse effects of Job on social well-being of people, we chose IIST Alumni as our sample space. We started by circulated a questionnaire among the Alumni to get a bigger picture - concluded that the impact was highly positive, improving social standards like standard of living, happiness, family income, respect in the society. For better insights, we interviewed 6 people individually by interacting with on phone by asking about their life before and after job. My part also included analysing the questionnaire using Excel.
